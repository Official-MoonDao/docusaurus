### Tutorial to get started at MoonDAO:
1. [Join our Discord](http://discord.gg/moondao)
2. Go through the onboarding process
   1. Post in the [introduce yourself](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/917524355242663977)
   2. [Get the governance token](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395&chain=mainnet). As much or as little as you’d like. This is your stake in the community. [Lock](https://app.moondao.com/lock) it in the MoonDAO app for governance power.
   3. [Verify your holdings on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/945284940721975356). The rest of the community governance and guild channels won’t be opened up until you do this step.
   4. Join an [onboarding call](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1100164221729243338/1108845367627366480) to get direct support from a steward.
3. [Join a guild](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1108226019359477860/1108811090747461803). Show us your skills, get added to a guild and learn how MoonDAO works. This is our quality filter for ensuring people have the required backgrounds to contribute to our community. Space is for everyone! But we want to filter out bad actors and scammers to maintain a good culture.
4. (Optional) Work for MoonDAO.
   1. Join an existing project -- come to a guild meeting to be matched to a project.
   2. Get paid retroactively with Coordinape (in other words your project teammates rate your performance afterwards).
