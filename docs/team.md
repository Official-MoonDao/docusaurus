**Disclaimer:** We're providing this info because we think it helps build trust to have our names and reputation behind this effort (we're not a rug pull). However we don't claim to be the "leaders" of this DAO, we're just helping guide it during its early life and then like proud parents will let it run free once it reaches maturity.

## Core team

### Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz

**Astronaut / Ops / Tech**

Hey I'm Pablo, I used to work at BigTech but dropped out after seeing where the world could be headed with centralized control over billions of people's lives. I see decentralization as an answer to fixing some of those problems. For the past year and a half I have worked on JuntoDAO to allow people to collectively govern their real life and digital assets with smart contacts. Basically making it easier to share things with your friends. I was also a core contributor at ConstitutionDAO (controversially, I "resigned"). Before that I worked at Waymo (Google's self driving car), YoutubeVR, and in biotech. I mostly grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and went to Michigan (go blue!), but I'm very culturally Spanish and lived in Zaragoza as a kid.
