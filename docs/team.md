## MoonDAO Members

### Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz

**Astronaut**

Hey I'm Pablo, I used to work at BigTech but dropped out after seeing where the world could be headed with centralized control over billions of people's lives. I see decentralization as an answer to fixing some of those problems. Previously I founded JuntoDAO to allow people to collectively govern their real life and digital assets with smart contacts, basically making it easier to share things with your friends. I was also a core contributor at ConstitutionDAO. Before that I worked at Waymo (Google's self driving car), YoutubeVR, and in biotech. I mostly grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and went to Michigan (go blue!), but I'm very culturally Spanish and lived in Zaragoza as a kid.
