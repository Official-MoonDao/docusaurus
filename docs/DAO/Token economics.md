# Token economics



$NATION serves as the entry point into the ecosystem, unlocking access to: 

- veNATION (by extension, participating in governance)
- NFT passports (by extension, participating in governance)
- the token-gated community on Discord (by virtue of holding NFT passports)
- liquidity rewards and governance mining

**Token Flow Chart
**![token flow chart](/img/Token_flow_chart.png "")

### veNATION
veNATION holders are those that bring more capital than time to the DAO. They take $NATION out of circulation due to their long-term commitment, creating a sink that might serve for $NATION to accrue value, and therefore capitalizing the Nation3 DAO.

In turn, thanks to that, members who commit their time can advance the mission of the DAO by making proposals, conducting research, and carrying out initiatives.

veNATION token is non-transferrable and can only be accessed by staking NATION for a period up from 1 week to 4 years. The proportion of veNATION for each $NATION staked correlates with the duration of the lock and it decrease with the pass of time.

**Holders’ rights:**

- veNATION holders are allowed to claim an NFT passport, should you want to become a Nation3 citizen. There’s a requirement of holding a minimum of 2.5 veNATION (equivalent to 10 $NATION locked up for a year) to claim a Genesis NFT passport, and a minimum of 1 veNATION to claim a Citizen NFT passport.
- Because longer-term commitment magnifies veNATION holdings, veNATION breaks the barrier to participation for those with minimal funds available: X $NATION staked for 4 years would give you enough veNATION to mint a Citizen NFT.

**Holders’ responsibilities:** 

- Governance responsibility is limited to ratifying the proposals made by Nation3 citizens — which is key for the project, yet requires minimal time commitment.

**Holders’ financial incentives:** 

- Boosted liquidity rewards when participating in active pools (eg $NATION / ETH Balancer pool).
- Share of future profits of the DAO as long as they perform their duties in regards to governance. This is not currently implemented since the DAO doesn’t have any revenue streams yet.
- Because longer-term commitment magnifies veNATION holdings, veNATION breaks the barrier to participation for those with minimal funds available: X $NATION staked for 4 years would give you enough veNATION to mint a Citizen NFT.


### NFT passports

NFT passport holders are the citizens of Nation3. They are the core users of its services, and simultaneously those that drive forward its progress. Nation3 citizens are the ones that make proposals, conduct research, carry out initiatives, structure themselves into working groups, and do everything else that’s required to successfully kickstart a cloud nation. They invest their time and expertise into the project, while making use of the funds from the Nation3 DAO.

In the first instance, Genesis NFTs could be minted by those who hold at least 10 veNATION. After 420 Genesis NFTs have been minted, Citizen NFTs would be issued with the maximum supply as agreed by the community to onboard more members.

NFT passports are non-transferrable, and can only be minted to those that hold the required amount of veNATION. If a veNATION holder who is a citizen doesn’t renew their lock, therefore lacking any long-term commitment, the NFT passport would be burned.

**Holders’ rights:** 

- Use all the services that Nation3 provides or will provide in the future, including physical spaces.
- Access to certain token-gated parts of public forums, such as Discord.
- Making proposals and making decisions within the Nation3 DAO (provided that those are ratified by veNATION holders).

**Holders’ responsibilities:** 

- Carrying the bulk of active governance responsibility. They are the only ones that can put proposals forward, and vote them to then be ratified by veNATION holders.

**Holders’ financial incentives:** 

- Rewarded through Governance Mining, meaning that they receive XX NATION per month as long as they meet their governance responsibilities. (Not implemented yet)
- All of the veNATION financial incentives, as they are also veNATION holders.

All citizens are veNATION holders, but not all veNATION holders are citizens.

This creates economic alignment while maintaining the checks and balances resulting from both groups participating in governance — essentially a bicameral system.
