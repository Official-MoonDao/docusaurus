# $NATION

$NATION is needed in order to mint a passport NFT and become a citizen of Nation3. This ensures that citizens have long-term economic alignment.

$NATION therefore acts as a dynamic pricing mechanism for citizenship.

It also allows the DAO to finance itself, as the DAO holds the majority of the initial supply.
