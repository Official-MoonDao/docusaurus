#MoonDAO Roadmap:

##2022
Launch someone past the karman line using a crowdfunding campaign and MoonDAO's decentralized governance framework.
Launch an on-chain sweepstakes to demonstrate MoonDAO's ability to transcend national borders and provide access to space for anyone regardless of financial means.
Develop a structure for MoonDAO projects, governance, incentives and long-term roadmap coordination, including plans to build a lunar settlement.

##2023
Establish partnerships with universities, aerospace companies, and research institutions, and DAOs, to collaborate on space-related research and development projects.
Create an open-innovation protocol for raising money towards roadmap initiatives and creating grants and prize bounties for teams or individuals that complete the prize.
Create and launch a decentralized marketplace for space-related products and services.
Prove out initial sales business models with projects that build on top of the core MoonDAO foundation like ZeroG flights, Lifeship, etc.

##2024
Design, build, test, and deploy a physical spacecraft that opens up access to Lunar communications to anyone on Earth, and is operated in a decentralized manner by MoonDAO.
Create an open-world, multiplayer 3D environment to allow anyone to create a proposal through MoonDAO governance and collectively design the first lunar settlement.
Further scale the community through a full all-in-one UI web application that allows users to onboard to the community, join guilds, create projects, govern, and automate incentives.
Further scale information systems with notifications and news coordinated automatically through LLMs and generative AI integration into MoonDAO to help scale our governance, incentives, projects, documentation, and general information infrastructure.

##2025
Purchase tickets to send MoonDAO members on a future lunar mission, proving the organization's capability for collective action on an even larger mission.
Finalize designs for the MVP of the MoonDAO lunar settlement and sign agreements with major aerospace companies to secure necessary resources to coordinate those plans.

##2026
Run a selection process for the people who will represent MoonDAO on the lunar surface and help build the first settlement.

##2027
Finish manufacturing, and testing of key settlement infrastructure, robotics, and tools that will support the first astronauts for the minimum viable settlement.

##2028
Send the first members to the Moon and begin construction of the minimum viable settlement.

##2029
Continue construction of the minimum viable settlement, including establishing a self-sustaining ecosystem with the help of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technology, self-sustaining energy, and life-support systems.

##2030
Complete construction of the minimum viable settlement and begin expanding it to accommodate more members.
Host a New Year's Eve party on the Moon, inviting nations committed to peaceful activity on the Moon and Earth to celebrate the accomplishment of MoonDAO's first mission.
